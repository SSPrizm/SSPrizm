- 👋 Hi, I’m @SSPrizm.
- 👀 I’m currently interested in Game Development, and Cyber Security.
- 🌱 I’ve recently learned about the no code and low code application development platforms. I had a little bit of experience with the no code development platform "XPoda"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate based on projects that are about what I am interested in. It will definitely make me gain more experience from it.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me by sending me a message.
